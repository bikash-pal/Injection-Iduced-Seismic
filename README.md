# Injection-Iduced-Seismic
A data Science project in which we tried to find correlation between water injected during and earthquake.  

Beginning in 2009, the frequency of earthquakes in the U.S. State of Oklahoma rapidly increased from an average of fewer than two 3.0+ magnitude earthquakes per year since 1978 to hundreds per year in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Thousands of earthquakes have occurred in Oklahoma and surrounding areas in southern Kansas and North Texas since 2009. Scientific studies attribute the rise in earthquakes to the disposal of wastewater produced during oil extraction that has been injected deeply into the ground. (Wikipedia)

Injection wells are utilized to dispose of fluid created as a byproduct of oil and gas production activities. Likewise, hydraulic fracturing, ie "fracking", produces large byproducts of
water. This byproduct is then injected deep back into the earth via disposal/injection wells.

Project Inspiration
1. Is there a correlation between earthquakes and injection well activity?
2. Can the data be used as a predictor of general proximity and/or time of future earthquakes ?

Dataset
This dataset contains two data files. One detailing "active" saltwater injection wells in Oklahoma, as of September 2017. The second file lists earthquakes in the Oklahoma region
(Oklahoma and surrounding states) since 1977.

Data was gathered from Oklahoma Corporation Commission and The United States Geological Survey.
